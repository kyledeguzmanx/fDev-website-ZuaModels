# ZUA MODELING GROUP 

## INTRODUCTION
This project is a single-page website built with ReactJs for a fictious high-fashion modeling agency: ZUA MODELS. It will be my first independent project using React.   

For this project, in addition to prioritizing a single-page archiecture, I really want to bring lazy loading into this project. The roster for these modeling agencies are always very lengthy, and it would be cool if these images loaded upon scroll to boost web page loading time.

And since these modeling sites tend to be very visual and media-content heavy, I also want to introduce some sort of minifying npm package.
